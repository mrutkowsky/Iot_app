This app consist of 3 fake IoT signals developed based on csv files, one main API for managing those apps, templates for web interface and few tools to 
make it more interesting.

Library picked for creating API is Flask based on it's simplicity.

You can change frequency of sending signals or stop them. Also it is posible to change the domain, where signals are being send.

Feel free to contribute and create some cool new features :)
